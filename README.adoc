= Loxide

Rust implementation of https://craftinginterpreters.com/[*Lox language*] interpreter for our https://snpefk.github.io/bookclub/[CS Bookclub].

== Goals

Because it's an educational project with its primary goal to learn crafting interpreters from scratch, the project doesn't strive to provide any sane user experience or ease of use. The code is probably a mess. It's certainly unoptimized. None of that is going to change !

Other small goals I try to achieve with this implementation:

* As much _zero-copy_ as possible;
* Error accumulation and propagation using _Result_;
* As little memory allocations as possible, i.e. return `impl Iterator` wherever possible.
